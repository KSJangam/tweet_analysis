# tweet_analysis

This is a project my friend and I worked on for our data wrangling course as part of the Masters program.

Were were tasked with scraping data from any online source and analyzing the data.

We decided to scrape data from twitter.com using R's rtweet package.

Our goal was to show how twitter data can be used to check how people handle the covid pandemic during the year 2022.

Please read the final report for more information.
