We're dealing today with the following news: (1/8)

"2132","For every person that died from COVID-19, we (the world) killed two due to ‚Äúother things‚Äù.

Are we causing twice more harm than good? (7/8)",16

NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

- 5 millions died from COVID-19
- 10 millions died due to causes not caused by COVID-19 itself that we‚Äôre not supposed to occur (more than would be expected)
(4/8)",15
"2135","This is clear: PEOPLE DIED TWICE MORE FROM OTHER CAUSES DUE TO ASPECTS RELATED TO THE PANDEMICS (I won‚Äôt say the causes I consider) THAN FROM COVID-19. (5/8)",13
"2136","Post-COVID complications, including increase in cardiovascular events, thrombosis, etc, may also account for many cases, and could be perfectly avoided if treated early. Mortality directly related to COVID-19 is not everything we should worry about when treating COVID-19.
(6/8)",14
"2137","The correct interpretation is: there were 15 million more deaths than expected for the period of the pandemic, but not necessarily due to COVID-19, but DUE TO ANY CAUSE instead.

15 million deaths that weren‚Äôt supposed to happen. (3/8)",16
