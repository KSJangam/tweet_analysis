## Scrapping the data

Here we will use the rtweet package to obtain a number of recent tweets that have the keyword "pandemic". We also filter for comments with more than 10 likes to avoid bot responses. 

```{r scraping}
rt <- search_tweets(
  q="pandemic", n = 1800, type = "recent", include_rts = FALSE
)

rt%>%filter(favorite_count>10)%>%select("text", "favorite_count")
```

## Cleaning the data


```{r cleaning}
```
